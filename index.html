        My husband Phil and I have been together for 31 years and married for 22.  Our daughter Stephanie is a junior at Purdue University (Boiler Up!) and is studying to be an environmental engineer.  She is outspoken and passionate about the things she loves.
         Our son Cameron is a senior at Oyster River High School (go Bobcats!).  He is an athlete and a theater kid.  He hopes to play varsity baseball and be in the school musical this spring. I will try not to bore my fellow Boot Campers too much with stories about them.</p>
        <p>
            I am currently training to run the Chicago Marathon in October.  This will be my fifth marathon.  Other marathons I have run include:
        <ul>
            <li>Seacoast Rockfest (2010)</li>
            <li>Clarence de Mar in Keene, NH (2013)</li>
            <li>Boston Marathon (2015)</li>
            <li>Marine Corps Marathon in DC (2017)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Other favorite races include Reach the Beach, Disney Princess Half Marathon, the Great Island 5k and the Wine and Dine 10k and Half Marathon races at Disney.   </p>
